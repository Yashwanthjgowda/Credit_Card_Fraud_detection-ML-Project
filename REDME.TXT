Credit card fraud detection using linear regression involves analyzing transaction data
to identify patterns and predict fraudulent activity. 
By training a linear regression model on historical transaction data,
we can detect anomalies by examining deviations from expected behavior.
The model helps flag suspicious transactions based on features such as transaction amount, frequency, and location.
This approach, though simple, can be an effective first step in developing a fraud detection system, 
which can later be enhanced with more complex algorithms.
